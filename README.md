# pacman-factory

**Name:** PacMan Factory.

**Description:** PacMan is a popular video game character from the 80's that moves around the screen eating small dots and avoiding ghosts. Score as many points as you can eating the small dots all around the maze. This particular project is to create new pacman characters with the click of a button and each of them will move around the browser window at their own pace. This project showcases how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) on the web with JavaScript.

**Usage:** Open the browser and click the "Add PacMan" button. A new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen. Add as many as you wish by clicking the button. When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created will start moving at random velocity on the screen.

**Roadmap:** Future improvements may be available to include the dots and ghosts. This is still TBD.
